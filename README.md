# Edge-AI Smart Wi-Fi Load Balancer for High-Density Environments

This repository contains a MATLAB-based simulation that demonstrates an Edge-AI approach for smart Wi-Fi load balancing in high-density environments such as university lecture halls.

The project compares static client allocation with an AI-style load balancing strategy that redistributes users proactively to reduce congestion. Performance is evaluated using key network metrics including latency, packet loss, and Jain’s fairness index.
